# ItsaGramLiveBot
### It's a telegram bot based on the original ItsAGramLive

### The ideia is to create a bot version so that you can go live in your instagram ( OBSStudio / Wirecast / VMix alike ) WITHOUT the need of a python installation.

#
#### bot.py is a copy of ItsAGramLive.py and has been modified with pyTelegramBotAPI
#
___**WORKS:**
- login (if the account has NO two-factor authentication) 
- go live, rtmp server link and stream key
- Info
- viewers
- comments
- mute comments
- unmute comments
- chat
- pin
- unpin
- wave
- stop
- save to IGTV (sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't - not sure why)
 
___**TO DO:**
- two-factor authentication
- chalenge mode ( SMS / Email )

-------------------------------------

### Token setup
- Install dotenv
```bash
pip install python-dotenv
```


- Create a file .env, in the root directory, paste your token given by @BotFather in TELEGRAM as follows:
####
token = 'blablbalablabalabalbaalabalbbla'
