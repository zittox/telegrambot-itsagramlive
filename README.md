# ItsaGramLiveBot
#
### This project is a telegram bot that was made possible by the original ItsAGramLive from [HarryPython](https://github.com/harrypython/itsagramlive) and has been modified with [pyTelegramBotAPI](https://github.com/eternnoir/pyTelegramBotAPI)
#
### The ideia is to create a bot version so that you can go live in your instagram with a streaming software ( OBSStudio / Wirecast / VMix alike ) WITHOUT the need of a python installation.





#
### The live is automatically archived in instagram live archive.
You can view, share and download your completed broadcast within the Live Archive. To access the Live Archive:

    1 - While on your profile tap the menu (3 horizontal lines) button in the top right corner.

    2 - Within this menu, tap the Archive button. 

    3 - Tap the dropdown at the top of the screen and switch from “Stories Archive” to “Live Archive.” 

    4 - You will then see your past completed live videos and be able to share to Instagram or download to your device.
